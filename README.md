# Opportunity tree and Reward/Compensation Scores

Set of R-functions to estimate the Opportunity Tree (O-tree) and the Reward and Compensation Scores as defined in Moramarco et al. (2024).

Files:

function_otree.R: this script contains the function producing the O-tree and the reward and compensation scores. Some comments clarify the arguments to be plugged.

to_run.R: this script runs the functions and computes and example exercise of an ad-hoc type
partition. The script computes an O-tree and then estimates the associated (gini) Inequality of Opportunity, and the reward and compensation scores.

data.csv: example data used to run the example.
